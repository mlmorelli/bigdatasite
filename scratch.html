                  In 2017, the Thomas Reuters Foundation published a poll portraying Mexico City as the 4th most dangerous city for women regarding sexual violence, which was defined as “rape or sexual attacks and harassment.” Figures representing violence against women have been increasing since that year. In the first ten months of 2019, 50 feminicides were recorded in Mexico City (Infobae, 2019). On November 25th, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, almost 3,000 participants marched under the theme “Not One Woman Less” (Ni Una Menos) in demand for the government to address women’s safety as an urgent matter. On February of this year, the feminicides of the 25-year-old Íngrid Escamilla and the 7-year-old Fátima Cecilia Aldrighett, triggered feminist collectives’ –and thousands of women’s –frustration towards how the system is failing to protect them. Daily demonstrations in Mexico City’s most iconic public plazas took place. On March 9th, a day after the International Women’s day, Mexican women took a different approach to their protests by declaring “A Day Without Women.” This demonstration sought to portray how empty Mexico City’s public spaces would look by asking women to stay home for one day. This silent protest elucidates the importance of women’s right to the city –a right which is being hampered by fear due to this pervasive climate of harassment and violence against women. Women in Mexico City are not safe, they are continuously vulnerable to sexual harassment and abuse.

<!-- Why is women’s safety important? -->

                <p class="text-white-50">
                  As a result of the region’s gendered violence, women have limited their use of public space as a survival mechanism resulting from a persistent fear of violence. This fear of violence constitutes a constant state of alert not only to the most vicious forms of gendered violence –rape and feminicide –but to the smaller and more subtle modes of harassment which exist in a continuity in space as a woman travels throughout the city. It is the gestures, the catcalls, the pursuing, and the groping of women in public space which makes them feel vulnerable and uncomfortable. Fear of violence obliges women to be wary when using the city, forcing them to avoid certain areas when possible and hindering their right to the city.
                  Policies and design usually follow findings from aggregated data. In the case of transport, for instance, when data about travel patterns is aggregated, the most common route is commuting. However, if this data is disaggregated, women’s travel patterns are revealed as much more complex than men’s. This is what Inés Sanchez de Madariaga calls ‘the mobility of care’, which elucidates the complexity of women’s use of the city, while not only working but also taking care of family members and the household. This is why we need to understand women’s experience of the city and design inclusively for women too. It is only by acknowledging their needs that they will recover their right to the city.

                  The data on the map shows the reports in 2019 in the research files of the General Prosecutor of Justice (Fiscalía General de Justicia) of Mexico City. On this year, they received 1799 reports of sexual harassment: 1683 of these were reported by women and 108 by men. They received 7167 reports of sexual abuse: 6330 from women and 782 from men. They received 2252 reports of rape: 2046 from women and 203 from men. The data clearly shows this is an issue that impacts women in a much larger way than men.
